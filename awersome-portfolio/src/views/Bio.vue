      Passionate about web development and curious about all that is done in
      terms of new technologies. <br />I like to try new technologies to realize
      my various projects always to try to satisfy my desire of creation and my
      insatiable curiosity. <br />
      I like to combine my passion for computer science with my other passions,
      such as electronic music production, design, cinema, photography by
      creating different projects around these universes.
